Homework4.py that plays Tik Tak Toe with a server. It was for a computer networking class so the key to this was learning how to use the Socket library

projectSaveTheWorld.asm was a game created that made the user guess a word in assembly language. Itâ€™s just like hangman except the man's parts are reduced instead of built.

Back Up HW 1 was a program I created for my big data analytics class. It takes a weather file and finds the finds the temperature highs and lows based on a recorded wind speed. Its best run in Jupyter notebooks
1901 and 1902 are the files that HW 1 works off of.

Square.java take in a length of a side and returns a square. Cube.java inherits and extends the square class and returns a cube. demoSquare is the main function and it calls each class to demonstrate them.
